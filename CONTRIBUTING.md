Gravitino's maintainers evaluate pull requests, offer feedback, and assist in merging project changes.

## Development setup

Once you have cloned the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datastrato/gravitino), see [how to build](/docs/how-to-build) for instructions on how to build, or you can use the provided docker images at [Datastrato's DockerHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/datastrato).

To stop and start a local Gravitino server via ``bin/gravitino.sh start`` and ``bin/gravitino.sh stop`` in a Gravitino distribution, see [how to build](/docs/how-to-build) for more instructions.

## Testing

The CI infrastructure runs unit and integration tests on each pull request, please make sure these tests pass before making a pull request.

The unit tests run on every build and integration tests run as needed. See [how to test](docs/how-to-test) for more information.

When adding new code or fixing a bug be sure to add unit tests to provide coverage.

## Coding standards

Spotless checks code formatting. If your code isn't correctly formatted, the build fails. To correctly format your code please use Spotless.

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

All files must have a license header and the build fails if any files are missing license headers. If you are adding third-party code be sure to understand how to add the third-party license to Gravitino LICENSE and NOTICE files.

For any bugs or new code please add unit tests to provide coverage of the code. The project may not accept code without unit tests.
