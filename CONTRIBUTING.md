## Getting started

### Fork the repository

Either click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository's page on GitHub OR create a fork on your local machine using `git clone`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datastrato/gravitino.git
cd gravitino
```

### Development Setup

Once you have cloned the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datastrato/gravitino), see [how to build](/docs/how-to-build.md) for instructions on how to build, or you can use the provided docker images at [Datastrato's DockerHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/datastrato).

To stop and start a local Gravitino server via `bin/gravitino.sh start` and `bin/gravitino.sh stop` in a Gravitino distribution, see [how to build](/docs/how-to-build.md) for more instructions.

### Using IntelliJ (Optional)

**On Windows:**

1. Open the Gravitino project that was just downloaded.

2. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and change to the SDK you downloaded in WSL.

3. If the SDK does not appear, manually add the SDK.

4. To find the SDK location, run this command in WSL:

    **On Ubuntu (WSL):**
    ```sh
    which java
    ```

IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development. Setting the project SDK ensures that IntelliJ uses the correct Java version for building and running the project.

You can open up WSL in the IntelliJ terminal. Find the down arrow and select ubuntu.

### Using VS Code (Optional)

#### Set up WSL Extension in VSCode

**On Windows:**

1. Open VSCode extension marketplace, search for and install **WSL**.

2. On Windows, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette, and run `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.

Installing the WSL extension in VSCode allows you to open and edit files in your WSL environment directly from VSCode. Adding the `code` command to your PATH enables you to open VSCode from the WSL terminal.

#### Verify and Configure Environment Variables

**On Windows:**

1. Add VSCode path to the environment variables. The default installation path for VSCode is usually:

    ```plaintext
    C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin
    ```

    Replace `<Your-Username>` with your actual Windows username.

    Example:

    ```plaintext
    C:\Users\epic\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin
    ```

Adding VSCode to the environment variables ensures that you can open VSCode from any command prompt or terminal window.

**On Ubuntu (WSL):**

```sh
code --version
cd gravitino
code .
```

Running `code --version` verifies that the `code` command is available. Using `code .` opens the current directory in VSCode.

#### Open a WSL Project in Windows VSCode

**On Ubuntu (WSL):**

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**

   Use the terminal to navigate to the directory of your project. For example:

   ```sh
   cd gravitino
   ```

2. **Open the Project in VSCode**

   In the WSL terminal, type the following command to open the current directory in VSCode:

   ```sh
   code .
   ```

  This command will open the current WSL directory in VSCode on Windows. If you haven't added `code` to your path, follow these steps:

- Open VSCode on Windows.

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.

- Type and select `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.

3. **Ensure Remote - WSL is Active**

   When VSCode opens, you should see a green bottom-left corner indicating that VSCode is connected to WSL. If it isn't, click on the green area and select `Remote-WSL: New Window` or `Remote-WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL`.

4. **Edit and Develop Your Project**

   You can now edit and develop your project files in VSCode as if they were local files. The Remote - WSL extension seamlessly bridges the file system between Windows and WSL.

### Handling Memory Issues in WSL

If you ran into a memory issue when using WSL, here are some solutions to resolve it.

1. **Shut down WSL**  
   If your WSL is open, you can shut it down in Windows PowerShell using the following command:  

   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

2. **Navigate to user folder**  

   Open up File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Users\<your-username>`.

3. **Create the `.wslconfig` file**  

   Open up Notepad or another text editor and input the following:  

   ```plaintext
   [wsl2]
   memory=4GB   # Limits VM memory in WSL 2 up to 4GB
   processors=4 # Makes the WSL 2 VM use four virtual processors
   ```

   *The memory and processor usage can be changed depending on your system's hardware.*

4. **Save the file**  

   Save the file as `".wslconfig"`. Be sure to include the quotes to let Windows know that this isn't a text file.

### The Review Process

For details on the review process, please refer to [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

## Testing

The CI infrastructure runs unit and integration tests on each pull request, please make sure these tests pass before making a pull request.

The unit tests run on every build and integration tests run as needed. See [how to test](docs/how-to-test.md) for more information.

When adding new code or fixing a bug be sure to add unit tests to provide coverage.

## Coding standards

Spotless checks code formatting. If your code isn't correctly formatted, the build fails. To correctly format your code please use Spotless.

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

All files must have a license header and the build fails if any files are missing license headers. If you are adding third-party code be sure to understand how to add the third-party license to Gravitino LICENSE and NOTICE files.

For any bugs or new code please add unit tests to provide coverage of the code. The project may not accept code without unit tests.

All text files should use macOS/unix style line endings (LF) not windows style line endings (CRLF).
