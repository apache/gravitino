## Creating Pull Requests

Create a new branch from ``main`` for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Make your changes and commit them. Be sure to write clear and concise commit messages.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push your-branch-name
```

After you have pushed your changes, create a pull request (PR) on our repository. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your changes, reference any related issues and please follow the template provided.

## Development Setup

Once you have cloned the repo [Github](https://github.com/datastrato/gravitino), see [how to build](/docs/how-to-build) for instructions on how to build, or you can use our docker images at [datastrato](https://hub.docker.com/u/datastrato) DockerHub repository.

To stop and start a local Gravitino server via ``bin/gravitino.sh start`` and ``bin/gravitino.sh stop`` in a Gravitino distribution, see [how to build](/docs/how-to-build) for more instructions.

## Testing

Our CI infrastructure will run unit and integration tests on each pull request, please make sure these tests pass before making a pull request.

We have unit tests that are run on every build and integration tests that can be run as needed. See [integration tests](docs/integration-test.md) for more in.

When adding new code or fixing a bug be sure to add unit tests to provide coverage.

## Coding Standards

We use Spotless to check code formatting, if your code is not correctly formatted then the build will fail. To correctly format your code please use Spotless.

```bash
./grawdlew spotlessApply
```

All files must have a license header and the build will fail if any files are missing license headers. If you are adding 3rd party code be sure to understand what needs to be listed in the LICENSE and NOTICE files.

For any bugs or new code please add unit tests to provide coverage of the code, code without unit tests may not be accepted.

## Community and Communication
