# In build.gradle.kts, we would automatic replace GRAVITINO_VERSION to the current version of Gravitino
# when running `./gradlew compileDistribution` or `./gradlew compileIcebergRESTServer` command.

# Debug Gravitino server
# export GRAVITINO_DEBUG_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 -Dlog4j2.debug=true"

# export JAVA_HOME
# export GRAVITINO_HOME
# export GRAVITINO_CONF_DIR
# export GRAVITINO_LOG_DIR     # Where log files are stored.  PWD by default.
# export GRAVITINO_MEM         # JVM memory options for the Gravitino server, Iceberg REST server, and Lance REST server.
#                             # Default: -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
#                             # Appended to JAVA_OPTS by launch scripts; set GRAVITINO_MEM to change heap/metaspace sizes.

# UI selection behaviour:
# - By default the template sets `GRAVITINO_USE_WEB_V2=false` which forces the V1 UI.
# - To enable the v2 UI you can set it to `true` (for example: `export GRAVITINO_USE_WEB_V2=true`).
