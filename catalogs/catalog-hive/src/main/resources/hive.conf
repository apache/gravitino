## This file holds common properties for hive catalog and metastore, for more, please refer to
## `org.apache.hadoop.hive.conf.HiveConf`

## If we want to specify Hive catalog-related configuration like 'hive.metastore.client.capability.check', we can do it like this:
## gravitino.bypass.hive.metastore.client.capability.check = true, and 'gravitino.bypass' is the prefix that
## the configuration will be directly by pass to backend engine, and 'hive.metastore.client.capability.check' is the configuration key.
gravitino.bypass.hive.metastore.client.capability.check = false
