/**
 * The securable object is the entity which access can be granted. Unless allowed by a grant, access
 * is denied. Gravitino organizes the securable objects using tree structure. The securable object
 * may be a catalog, a table or a schema, etc. For example, `catalog1.schema1.table1` represents a
 * table named `table1`. It's in the schema named `schema1`. The schema is in the catalog named
 * `catalog1`. Similarly, `catalog1.schema1.topic1` can represent a topic.
 * `catalog1.schema1.fileset1` can represent a fileset. `*` represents all the catalogs. If you want
 * to use other securable objects which represents all entities," you can use their parent entity,
 * For example if you want to have read table privileges of all tables of `catalog1.schema1`, " you
 * can use add `read table` privilege for `catalog1.schema1` directly
