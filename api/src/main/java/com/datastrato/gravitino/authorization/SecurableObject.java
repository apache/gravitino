/**
 * The securable object is the entity which access can be granted. Unless allowed by a grant, access
 * is denied. Gravitino organizes the securable objects using tree structure. <br>
 * There are three fields in the securable object: parent, name, and type. <br>
 * The types include 6 kinds: CATALOG,SCHEMA,TABLE,FILESET,TOPIC and METALAKE. <br>
 * You can use the helper class `SecurableObjects` to create the securable object which you need.
 * <br>
 * You can use full name and type of the securable object in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * For example, <br>
 * If you want to use a catalog named `catalog1`, you can use the code
 * `SecurableObjects.ofCatalog("catalog1")` to create the securable object, or you can use full name
 * `catalog1` and type `CATALOG` in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * If you want to use a schema named `schema1` in the catalog named `catalog1`, you can use the code
 * `SecurableObjects.ofSchema(catalog, "schema1")` to create the securable object, or you can use
 * full name `catalog1.schema1` and type `SCHEMA` in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * If you want to use a table named `table1` in the schema named `schema1`, you can use the code
 * `SecurableObjects.ofTable(schema, "table1")` to create the securable object, or you can use full
 * name `catalog1.schema1.table1` and type `TABLE` in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * If you want to use a topic named `topic1` in the schema named `schema1`, you can use the code
 * `SecurableObjects.ofTopic(schema, "topic1")` to create the securable object, or you can use full
 * name `catalog1.schema1.topic1` and type `TOPIC` in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * If you want to use a fileset named `fileset1` in the schema named `schema1`, you can use the code
 * `SecurableObjects.ofFileset(schema, "fileset1)` to create the securable object, or you can use
 * full name `catalog1.schema1.fileset1` and type `FILESET` in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * If you want to use a metalake named `metalake1`, you can use the code
 * `SecurableObjects.ofMetalake("metalake1")` to create the securable object, or you can use full
 * name `metalake1` and type `METALAKE` in the RESTFUL API. <br>
 * If you want to use all the catalogs, you use the metalake to represent them. Likely, you can use
 * their common parent to represent all securable objects.<br>
 * For example if you want to have read table privileges of all tables of `catalog1.schema1`, " you
 * can use add `read table` privilege for `catalog1.schema1` directly
