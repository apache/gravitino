/**
 * An interface representing a fileset under a schema {@link Namespace}. A fileset is a virtual
 * concept of the file or directory that is managed by Apache Gravitino. Users can create a fileset
 * object to manage the non-tabular data on the FS-like storage. The typical use case is to manage
 * the training data for AI workloads. The major difference compare to the relational table is that
 * the fileset is schema-free, the main property of the fileset is the storage location of the
 * underlying data.
 *
 * <p>{@link Fileset} defines the basic properties of a fileset object. A catalog implementation
 * with {@link FilesetCatalog} should implement this interface.
