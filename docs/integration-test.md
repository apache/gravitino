## How to run integration tests

## Introduction

The `integration-test` module contains integration test cases to ensure the correctness of the
Gravitino server, API, and client. You can run these tests locally or on GitHub Actions.

## Test modes

### Running MiniGravitino in embedded mode

The `MiniGravitino` is a lightweight Gravitino server embedded in the integration test module.

1. Run the `./gradlew build -x test` command to build the Gravitino project.

2. Use the `./gradlew test [--rerun-tasks]` or `./gradlew test [--rerun-tasks] -PtestMode=embedded` commands to run the integration tests.

> Run the `./gradlew build` command to build the Gravitino project and run the integration tests in embedded mode.

The Gravitino server supports the following abilities:

- Running a Gravitino server in a single thread.
- Starting a Jetty server to provide the Gravitino server API, using a random port to avoid port conflicts.
- Using a random storage path to store backend data. Stopping MiniGravitino deletes the backend data.

### Deploying the Gravitino server locally

Deploy the Gravitino server locally to run the integration tests. Follow these steps:

1. Run the `./gradlew build -x test` command to build the Gravitino project.
2. Use the `./gradlew compileDistribution` command to compile and package the Gravitino project in the `distribution` directory.
3. Use the `./gradlew test [--rerun-tasks] -PtestMode=deploy` command to run the integration tests in the `distribution` directory.

### Skipping tests

- You can skip unit tests by using the `./gradlew build -PskipTests` command.
- You can skip integration tests by using the `./gradlew build -PskipITs` command.
- You can skip both unit tests and integration tests by using the `./gradlew build -x test` or `./gradlew build -PskipTests -PskipITs` commands.

## Docker test environment

Some integration test cases depend on the Gravitino CI Docker environment.

If an integration test relies on the specific Gravitino CI Docker environment,
you need to set the `@tag(gravitino-docker-it)` annotation in the test class.
For example, the `integration-test/src/test/.../CatalogHiveIT.java` test needs to connect to
the `datastrato/gravitino-ci-hive` Docker container for testing the Hive data source.
Therefore, it should have the following `@tag` annotation:`@tag(gravitino-docker-it)`, This annotation
helps identify the specific Docker container required for the integration test.
For example:

```java
@Tag("gravitino-docker-it")
public class CatalogHiveIT extends AbstractIT {
...
}
```

### Running all integration tests

If you're running `Docker server` and `mac-docker-connector` (only macOS needs to run `mac-docker-connector`), the `./gradlew test -PtestMode=[embedded|deploy]`
command runs all the test cases.

```text
------------------- Check Docker environment --------------------
Docker server status ............................................ [running]
mac-docker-connector server status .............................. [running]
Using Gravitino IT Docker container to run all integration tests. [embedded test]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Docker server or mac-docker-connector not running

Running the ./gradlew test -PtestMode=[embedded|deploy] command runs all test cases without the `gravitino-docker-it` tag, when the `Docker server` or `mac-docker-connector` (only required in MacOS) isn't running.

```text
------------------- Check Docker environment ------------------
Docker server status ............................................ [stop]
mac-docker-connector server status .............................. [stop]
Run test cases without `gravitino-docker-it` tag ................ [embedded test]
---------------------------------------------------------------
Tip: Please make sure to start the `Docker server` before running the integration tests.
Tip: Please make sure to run the `dev/docker/tools/mac-docker-connector.sh` script before running the integration tests in MacOS.
```

## Debugging Gravitino server and integration tests

By default, using MiniGravitino runs the integration tests. Debugging with MiniGravitino is simple and easy. You can modify any code in the Gravitino project and set breakpoints anywhere.

### How to debug deploy mode Gravitino server and integration tests

You have two modes to debug the Gravitino server and integration tests, the `embedded` and `deploy` modes.

1. Embedded Mode is the default:
    - This mode is simpler to debug but not as close to the actual environment.
    - Debugging with `MiniGravitino` is simple and easy. You don't have to do any setup to debug directly.

2. Deploy Mode:
    - This mode is closer to the actual environment but more complex to debug.
    - To debug the Gravitino server code, follow these steps:
        - Run the `./gradlew build -x test` command to build the Gravitino project.
        - Use the `./gradlew compileDistribution` command to republish the packaged project in the `distribution` directory.
        - If you only debug integration test codes, You don't have to do any setup to debug directly.
        - If you need to debug Gravitino server codes, follow these steps:
            - Enable the `GRAVITINO_DEBUG_OPTS` environment variable in the `distribution/package/conf/gravitino-env.sh` file to enable remote JVM debugging.
            - Manually start the Gravitino server using the `./distribution/package/bin/gravitino.sh start` command.
            - Select `gravitino.server.main` module classpath in the `Remote JVM Debug` to attach the Gravitino server process and debug it.

## Running on GitHub actions

- GitHub Actions automatically run integration tests in the embedded and deploy mode when you submit a pull request to the 'main' branch.
- View the test results in the `Actions` tab of the pull request page.
- Run the integration tests in several steps:

  - The Gravitino integration tests pull the CI Docker image from the Docker Hub repository. This step typically takes around 15 seconds.
  - If you set the `debug action` label in the pull request, GitHub actions runs an SSH server with `csexton/debugger-action@master`, allowing you to log in to the actions environment for remote debugging.
  - The Gravitino project compiles and packages in the `distribution` directory using the `./gradlew compileDistribution` command.
  - Run the `./gradlew test -PtestMode=[embedded|deploy]` command.

## Test failure

If a test fails, you can retrieve valuable information from the logs and test report. Test reports are in the `./build/reports` directory. The integration test logs are in the `./integrate-test/build` directory. In deploy mode, Gravitino server logs are in the `./distribution/package/logs/` directory. In the event of a test failure within the GitHub workflow, the system generates archived logs and test reports. To obtain the archive, follow these steps:

1. Click the `detail` link associated with the failed integrate test in the pull request. This redirects you to the job page.

2. On the job page, locate the `Summary` button on the left-hand side and click it to access the workflow summary page.

3. Look for the Artifacts item on the summary page and download the archive from there.
