Trino can manage and access data using the Trino connector provided by `Apache Gravitino`, commonly referred to as the `Gravitino connector`.
After configuring the Gravitino connector in Trino, Trino can automatically load catalog metadata from Gravitino, allowing users to directly access these catalogs in Trino.
Once integrated with Gravitino, Trino can operate on all Gravitino data without requiring additional configuration.
The Gravitino connector uses the [Trino dynamic catalog managed mechanism](https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/properties-catalog.html) to load catalogs.
When the Gravitino connector retrieves catalogs from the Gravitino server, it generates a `CREATE CATAGLOG` statement and executes
the statement on the current Trino server to register the catalogs with Trino

:::node
Once metadata such as catalogs are changed in Gravitino, Trino can update itself through Gravitino, this process usually takes
about 3~10 seconds.
:::

By default, the loading of Gravitino's catalogs into Trino follows the naming convention:

```text
{catalog}
```

Usage in queries is as follows:

```text
SELECT * from catalog.dbname.tablename
```
