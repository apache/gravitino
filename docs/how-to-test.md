Gravitino has two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests are mainly
focused on the functionalities of the specific class, module, or component. Integration tests
are end-to-end tests that cover the whole system.

:::note before test
* If you want to run the complete integration test suites, you need to install Docker in your
  environment.
* Please refer to [How to build Gravitino](./how-to-build.md) for more details to make sure you have
  a build environment ready.
* [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) can be used to replace Docker Desktop
  on macOS. OrbStack automatically configures the network between the Docker containers.
* If you are using Docker Desktop for macOS, please launch
  [mac-docker-connector](https://github.com/wenjunxiao/mac-docker-connector) before running the tests.
  You can read `$GRAVITINO_HOME/dev/docker/tools/README.md` and
  `$GRAVITINO_HOME/dev/docker/tools/mac-docker-connector.sh` for more details.
:::

## Run the unit tests

To run the unit test, you can simply run the following command:

```shell

./gradlew test -PskipITs
```

This command runs all the unit tests and skips the integration tests.

## Run the integration tests

Gravitino has two modes to run the integration tests, the default `embedded` mode and `deploy` mode.

* With the `embedded` mode, the integration test starts an embedded `MiniGravitino` server
  within the same process of the integration test to run the integration tests.
* With the `deploy` mode, the user has to build (`./gradlew compileDistribution`) a Gravitino binary package beforehand, the
  integration test launches and connects to the local Gravitino server to run the integration
  tests.

### Run the integration tests in embedded mode

1. Run the `./gradlew build -x test` command to build the Gravitino project.

2. Use the `./gradlew test [--rerun-tasks] -PskipTests -PtestMode=embedded` commands to run the
   integration tests.

:::note
Running the `./gradlew build` command triggers the build and runs the integration tests in embedded mode.
:::

### Deploy the Gravitino server and run the integration tests in deploy mode

Deploy the Gravitino server locally to run the integration tests. Follow these steps:

1. Run the `./gradlew build -x test` command to build the Gravitino project.
2. Use the `./gradlew compileDistribution` command to compile and package the Gravitino project
   in the `distribution` directory.
3. Use the `./gradlew test [--rerun-tasks] -PskipTests -PtestMode=deploy` command to run the
   integration tests in the `distribution` directory.
4. Use the `bash integration-test/trino-test-tools/trino_test.sh` command to run all the
   Trino test sets in the `integration-test/src/test/resources/trino-ci-testset/testsets` directory.

## Skip tests

* You can skip unit tests by using the `./gradlew build -PskipTests` command.
* You can skip backend and web frontend integration tests by using the `./gradlew build -PskipITs` command.
* You can only skip web frontend integration tests by using the `./gradlew build -PskipWebITs` command.
* You can skip both unit tests and all integration tests by using the `./gradlew build -x test` or `./gradlew build -PskipTests -PskipITs` commands.

## Docker test environment

Some integration test cases depend on the Gravitino CI Docker image.

If an integration test relies on the specific Gravitino CI Docker image,
you need to set the `@tag(gravitino-docker-it)` annotation in the test class.
For example, the `integration-test/src/test/.../CatalogHiveIT.java` test needs to connect to
the `datastrato/gravitino-ci-hive` Docker container for testing the Hive data source.
Therefore, it should have the following `@tag` annotation:`@tag(gravitino-docker-it)`, This annotation
helps identify the specific Docker container required for the integration test.

For example:

```java
@Tag("gravitino-docker-it")
public class CatalogHiveIT extends AbstractIT {
...
}
```

## Running all the integration tests

:::note
* You should make sure that the `Docker server` is running before running all the
  integration tests. Otherwise, it only runs the integration tests without the `gravitino-docker-it` tag.
* on macOS, please be sure to run the `${GRAVITINO_HOME}/dev/docker/tools/mac-docker-connector.sh`
  script before running the integration tests. Or, you should make sure that
  [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) is running.
:::

When integration tests run, it checks the whole environment and outputs the status of the
required environment, for example:

```text
------------------ Check Docker environment ---------------------
Docker server status ............................................ [running]
mac-docker-connector status ..................................... [stop]
OrbStack status ................................................. [yes]
Using Gravitino IT Docker container to run all integration tests. [deploy test]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

Only when all the required environments are ready, all the integration tests run, otherwise,
only parts of the integration tests without `gravitino-docker-it` tag run.

## How to debug Gravitino server and integration tests in embedded mode

By default, the integration tests run in the embedded mode, `MiniGravitino` starts in the same process. Debugging `MiniGravitino` is simple and easy. You can modify any code in the Gravitino project and set breakpoints anywhere.

## How to debug Gravitino server and integration tests in deploy mode

This mode is closer to the actual environment but more complex to debug. To debug the Gravitino server code, follow these steps:

* Run the `./gradlew build -x test` command to build the Gravitino project.
* Use the `./gradlew compileDistribution` command to republish the packaged project in the `distribution` directory.
* If you only debug integration test codes, You don't have to do any setup to debug directly.
* If you need to debug Gravitino server codes, follow these steps:
  * Enable the `GRAVITINO_DEBUG_OPTS` environment variable in the
  `distribution/package/conf/gravitino-env.sh` file to enable remote JVM debugging.
  * Manually start the Gravitino server using the `./distribution/package/bin/gravitino.sh
  start` command.
  * Select `gravitino.server.main` module classpath in the `Remote JVM Debug` to attach the
  Gravitino server process and debug it.

## Running on GitHub actions

* GitHub Actions automatically run integration tests in the embedded and deploy mode when you
  submit a pull request.
* View the test results in the `Actions` tab of the pull request page.
* Run the integration tests in several steps:
  * The Gravitino integration tests pull the CI Docker image from the Docker Hub repository. This step typically takes around 15 seconds.
  * If you set the `debug action` label in the pull request, GitHub actions runs an SSH server with `csexton/debugger-action@master`, allowing you to log into the GitHub actions environment for remote debugging.
  * The Gravitino project compiles and packages in the `distribution` directory using the `./gradlew compileDistribution` command.
  * Run the `./gradlew test -PtestMode=[embedded|deploy]` command.

## Test failure

If a test fails, you can retrieve valuable information from the logs and test reports. Test reports are in the `./build/reports` directory. The integration test logs are in the `./integrate-test/build` directory. In deploy mode, Gravitino server logs are in the `./distribution/package/logs/` directory. In the event of a test failure within the GitHub workflow, the system generates archived logs and test reports. To obtain the archive, follow these steps:

1. Click the `detail` link associated with the failed integration test in the pull request. This redirects you to the job page.

2. On the job page, locate the `Summary` button on the left-hand side and click it to access the workflow summary page.

3. Look for the Artifacts item on the summary page and download the archive from there.
