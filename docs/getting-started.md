## Getting started on Amazon Web Services

To begin using Gravitino on AWS, follow these steps:

1. In the AWS console, launch a new instance. Select `Ubuntu` as the operating system and `t2.xlarge` as the instance type. Create a key pair named *Gravitino.pem* for SSH access and download it. Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic if you want to connect to the instance remotely. Set the Elastic Block Store storage to 20GiB. Leave all other settings at their defaults. Other operating systems and instance types may work, but they have yet to be fully tested.

2. Start the instance and connect to it via SSH using the downloaded .pem file:

    ```shell
    ssh ubuntu@<IP_address> -i ~/Downloads/Gravitino.pem
    ```

   **Note**: you may need to adjust the permissions on your .pem file using `chmod 400` to enable SSH connections.

3. Update the Ubuntu OS to ensure it's up-to-date:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    You may need to reboot the instance for all changes to take effect.

4. Install the required Java Development Kit. Gravitino supports running on Java 8,

## Installing Apache Hive on AWS or Google Cloud Platform

If you already have Apache Hive and Apache Hadoop in your environment, you can ignore this section
and use them with Gravitino.

To install Apache Hive and Hadoop on AWS or Google Cloud Platform manually, follow [Apache Hive](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/) and
[Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html).

Installing and configuring Hive can be a little complex. If you don't already have Hive set up and running you can use the Docker container Datastrato provides to get Gravitino up and running.

Follow these instructions for setting up [Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

```shell
sudo docker run --name gravitino-container -d -p 9000:9000 -p 8088:8088 -p 50010:50010 -p 50070:50070 -p 50075:50075 -p 10000:10000 -p 10002:10002 -p 8888:8888 -p 9083:9083 -p 8022:22 datastrato/hive:2.7.3-no-yarn
```

Once Docker is installed, you can start the container with the command:

```shell
sudo docker start gravitino-container
```

## Installing Apache Hive locally

The same steps for installing Hive on AWS or Google Cloud Platform apply when installing it locally. Follow [Installing Apache Hive on AWS or Google Cloud Platform](#installing-apache-hive-on-aws-or-google-cloud-platform).

## Installing Apache Gravitino playground on AWS or Google Cloud Platform

Gravitino provides a bundle of Docker images to launch a Gravitino playground, which
includes Apache Hive, Apache Hadoop, Trino, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Gravitino. You can use
Docker Compose to start them all.

Installing Docker and Docker Compose is a requirement for using the playground. 

```shell
sudo apt install docker docker-compose
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
newgrp docker
```

You can install and run all the programs as Docker containers by using the
[gravitino-playground](https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground). For details about
how to run the playground, see [how-to-use-the-playground](./how-to-use-the-playground.md)

## Installing Apache Gravitino playground locally

The same steps for installing the playground on AWS or Google Cloud Platform apply when installing it locally. Follow [Installing Gravitino playground on AWS or Google Cloud Platform](#installing-gravitino-playground-on-aws-or-google-cloud-platform).

## Using REST to interact with Apache Gravitino

After starting the Gravitino distribution, issue REST commands to create and modify metadata. While you are using `localhost` in these examples, run these commands remotely via a hostname or IP address once you establish correct access.

1. Create a Metalake:

   ```shell
   curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"name":"metalake","comment":"Test metalake"}' http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes
   ```

   Verify the MetaLake's creation:

   ```shell
   curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes

   curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes/metalake
   ```

   Note that if you request a Metalake that doesn't exist, you get a *NoSuchMetalakeException* error.

   ```shell
   curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes/none
   ```

2. Create a catalog in Hive:

   First, list the current catalogs to verify that no catalogs exist.

   ```shell
   curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes/metalake/catalogs
   ```

   Create a new Hive catalog.

   ```shell
   curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"name":"test","comment":"Test catalog", "type":"RELATIONAL", "provider":"hive", "properties":{"metastore.uris":"thrift://localhost:9083"}}' \
   http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes/metalake/catalogs
   ```

   Verify creation of the catalog.

   ```shell
   curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.gravitino.v1+json" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://localhost:8090/api/metalakes/metalake/catalogs
   ```

   Note that the metastore.uris property is used for the Hive catalog and needs updating if you change your configuration.

## Accessing Apache Gravitino on AWS externally

When you deploy Gravitino on AWS, accessing it externally requires some additional configuration due to how AWS networking works.

AWS assigns your instance a public IP address, but Gravitino can't bind to that address. To resolve this, you must find the internal IP address assigned to your AWS instance. You can locate the private IP address in the AWS console, or by running the following command:

```shell
ip a
```

Once you have identified the internal address, edit the Gravitino configuration to bind to that
address. Open the file `<path-to-gravitino>/conf/gravitino.conf` and modify the `gravitino.server.
webserver.host` parameter from `127.0.0.1` to your AWS instance's private IP4 address; or you can use '0.0.0.0'. '0.0.0.0' in this context means the host's IP address. Restart the Gravitino server for the change to take effect.

```shell
<path-to-gravitino>/bin/gravitino.sh restart
```

You'll also need to open port 8090 in the security group of your AWS instance to access Gravitino. To access Hive you need to open port 10000 in the security group.

After completing these steps, you should be able to access the Gravitino REST interface from either the command line or a web browser on your local computer. You can also connect to Hive via DBeaver or any other database IDE.
