/**
 * TreeLock is a lock that manages the lock process of the resource path. It will lock the whole
 * path from root to the resource path.
 *
 * <p>Assuming we need to load the table `metalake.catalog.db1.table1`, the lock manager will lock
 * the following
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /                                    readLock
 *   /metalake                            readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog                    readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog/db1                readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog/db/table1          readLock
 * </pre>
 *
 * If we need to alter a table `metalake.catalog.db1.table1` (without changing the name of it), the
 * lock manager will lock the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /                                    readLock
 *   /metalake                            readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog                    readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog/db1                readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog/db/table1          writeLock
 * </pre>
 *
 * When we need to rename a table or drop a table `metalake.catalog.db1.table1`, the lock manager
 * will lock the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /                                    readLock
 *   /metalake                            readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog                    readLock
 *   /metalake/catalog/db1                writeLock
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the lock manager fails to lock the resource path, it will release all the locks that have been
 * locked in the inverse sequences it locks the resource path.
 *
 * <p>The core of {@link TreeLock} is {@link TreeLockNode}. A TreeLock will hold several tree lock
 * nodes, all treeLock nodes shared by all tree lock instances will be stored in the {@link
 * LockManager} and can be reused later.
