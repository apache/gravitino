# Hologres JDBC Configuration
# Hologres uses PostgreSQL JDBC driver for connections
#
# jdbc-url = jdbc:postgresql://{ENDPOINT}:{PORT}/{DBNAME}
# jdbc-user = your_access_id
# jdbc-password = your_access_key
# jdbc-database = your_database
# jdbc-driver = org.postgresql.Driver
#
# Optional parameters for better performance:
# - Add reWriteBatchedInserts=true for batch write optimization
# - Add ApplicationName=YourAppName for query tracking
#
# Example:
# jdbc-url = jdbc:postgresql://hgprecn-cn-xxx.hologres.aliyuncs.com:80/my_database?reWriteBatchedInserts=true&ApplicationName=Gravitino
