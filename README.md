## Introduction

Gravitino is a high-performance, geo-distributed, and federated metadata lake. It manages the metadata directly in different sources, types, and regions. It also provides users with unified metadata access for data and AI assets.

![Gravitino Architecture](docs/assets/gravitino-architecture.png)

Gravitino aims to provide several key features:

* Single Source of Truth for multi-regional data with geo-distributed architecture support.
* Unified Data and AI asset management for both users and engines.
* Security in one place, centralizing the security for different sources.
* Built-in data management and data access management.

## Building Gravitino

You can build Gravitino using Gradle. Currently you can build Gravitino on Linux and macOS, Windows isn't supported.

To build Gravitino, please run:

```shell
./gradlew clean build -x test
```

If you want to build a distribution package, please run:

```shell
./gradlew compileDistribution -x test
```

to build a distribution package.

Or:

```shell
./gradlew assembleDistribution -x test
```

to build a compressed distribution package.

The directory `distribution` contains the generated binary distribution package.

For the details of building and testing Gravitino, please see [How to build Gravitino](docs/how-to-build.md).

## Quick start

### Configure and start the Gravitino server

If you already have a binary distribution package, go to the directory of the decompressed package.
