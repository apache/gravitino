## Introduction

Gravitino is a high-performance, geo-distributed, and federated metadata lake. It manages the metadata directly in different sources, types, and regions. It also provides users with unified metadata access for data and AI assets.

* Single Source of Truth for multi-regional data with geo-distributed architecture support.
* Unified Data and AI asset management for both users and engines.
* Security in one place, centralizing the security for different sources.
* Built-in data management and data access management.
