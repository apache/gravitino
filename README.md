## Introduction

Gravitino is a high-performance, geo-distributed, and federated metadata lake. It creates and manages metadata from multiple different database sources and cloud providers directly, regardless of type and region. Users can then access the unified metadata using supported engines for data management and advanced analytics.

For a detailed overview of features, please see the [official documentation](https://datastrato.ai/docs).

You can find the latest Gravitino documentation in the [docs folder](docs). The official [website](https://datastrato.ai/docs) has docs for each official release.

## Installation

You can install Gravitino from the binary release package or Docker image, please follow the
[how-to-install](docs/how-to-install.md) to install Gravitino. Or, you can install Gravitino from scratch, please 
follow the documentation of
[how-to-build](docs/how-to-build.md) and [how-to-install](docs/how-to-install.md) to install Gravitino.


Gravitino requires **Java 8** to run. The optional trino-connector runs with Trino, and requires Java 17.

### Building from Source 

Gradle makes it easy to build Gravitino. To build Gravitino, please run:

```shell
./gradlew clean build -x test
```

If you want to build a distribution package, please run:

```shell
./gradlew compileDistribution -x test 
```
Or, you can also build a compressed distribution package with the following:
```shell
./gradlew assembleDistribution -x test 
```


The generated binary distribution package locates in `distribution` directory.

For the details of building and testing Gravitino, please see [How to build Gravitino](docs/how-to-build.md).

## Quick Start

### Configure and start the Gravitino server

If you already have a binary distribution package, please decompress the package (if required)
and go to the directory where the package locates.

Before starting the Gravitino server, please configure the Gravitino server configuration file. The
configuration file, `gravitino.conf`, located in the `conf` directory and follows the standard property file format. You can modify the configuration within this file.

To start the Gravitino server, please run:

```shell
./bin/gravitino.sh start
```

To stop the Gravitino server, please run:

```shell
./bin/gravitino.sh stop
```

For a more detailed step-by-step guide, see our [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.

### Using Trino with Gravitino

Gravitino provides a Trino connector to access the metadata in Gravitino. To use Trino with Gravitino, please follow the [trino-gravitino-connector doc](docs/trino-connector/index.md).
