Apache Gravitino is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache TLP sponsor. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision-making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF policy and while we have documented the licensing of all code in detail, we know that currently our release would:
- Contains code that may not be compatible with the Apache License

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine the overall implications of including this work.
