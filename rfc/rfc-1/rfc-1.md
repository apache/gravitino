## Design Prerequisites

1. The metadata spec should be evolved, backward compatible, and possibly forward compatible (If possible and necessary).
2. The on-wire protocol (user-faced interface) should be readable and debuggable by mainstream web-based tools.
3. The storage layout should be concise and performant, also be backward compatible.
4. The type and schema system should be generic enough to cover mainstream db/dws/dl’s schema system.
5. The schema can be evolved to support non-table datasets (stream, model).
6. The schema should be evolved to support Hive’s schema spec, so we could replace HMS later on.

## Design choices

1. We choose to leverage Substrait’s type system into our entities’ type system. The main considerations are here:
    1. The goal of Substrait is to build a generic intermediate layer, its type system is relatively complete.
    2. We will further use Substrait to represent our logical plans (for example, like view, function and others), so using Substrait’s type system will reduce some converting works later on.
2. We choose JSON protocol as our user-faced protocol, which is easy to debug for users and systems.
3. We choose Protobuf binary layout to store the schema, the main considerations are here:
    1. Binary layout is much more concise compared to HMS’s schema layout.
    2. A general-purpose NoSQL database can be used to store the schema, which will get better performance and scalability compared to Hive Metastore.

## Type System

We use Substrait’s type system to define our schema’s type, the advantages of using Substrait’s type system is that:

1. Substrait’s type system is generic enough to cover major type kinds of DWS, DBS, and other type system.
2. Substrait supports extending the type systems to user-defined types.
3. Substrait support serializing and deserializing using Google protobuf.

Disadvantages:

1. Substrait is still in fast iteration, the spec is not fully defined yet, also the project is not mature enough. So we potentially have the risk of breaking backward compatibility.
2. Also Substrait lacks best practices, the learning curve is relatively high.

Substrait’s type system can be referred here https://substrait.io/types/type_system/.

## Schema System

### Prerequisites

1. The field name of schema should use lowercase with "_" connecting different words, the name convention is `^[a-z](?:_?[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
1. The schema system uses Google Protobuf to describe the structs.

### Schema Entities
