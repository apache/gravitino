# RFC-1: Metadata Spec Design

| Revision | Owner      |
| :------- | ---------- |
| v0.1     | Jerry Shao |
| v0.2     | Jerry Shao |

## Design Prerequisites

1. The metadata spec should be evolved, backward compatible, and possibly forward compatible (If possible and necessary).
2. The on-wire protocol (user-faced interface) should be readable and debuggable by mainstream web-based tools.
3. The storage layout should be concise and performant, also be backward compatible.
4. The type and schema system should be generic enough to cover mainstream db/dws/dl’s schema system.
5. The schema can be evolved to support non-table datasets (stream, model).
6. The schema should be evolved to support Hive’s schema spec, so we could replace HMS later on.

## Design choices

1. We choose JSON protocol as our user-faced protocol, which is easy to debug for users and systems.
2. We choose Protobuf binary layout to store the schema, the main considerations are here:
   1. Binary layout is much more concise compared to HMS’s schema layout.
   2. A general-purpose NoSQL database can be used to store the schema, which will get better performance and scalability compared to Hive Metastore.

## Meta System

### Prerequisites

1. The field name of schema should use lowercase with "_" connecting different words, the name convention is `^[a-z](?:_?[a-z0-9]+)\*$`.
2. The schema system uses Google Protobuf to describe the structs.

### Schema Entities

The schema system in Apache Gravitino is organized like below:

![Schema System](schema-overview.png)

1. **Metalake**: metalake is a top-level container that manages all the metadata from DB/EDW, Hive/Iceberg/Hudi, plain files, MQ and others.
2. **Catalog**: catalog is a collection of metadata from a specific metadata source. For example, “hive.db.table” means this table belongs to Hive catalog under the DB “db”.
3. **Connector**: connector is 1 to 1 mapping to catalog, 1 connector is binding to 1 catalog, and 1 catalog only has 1 connector. The connector defines how to connect the underlying metadata source.
4. **Metadata Structure**: metadata structure is defined per metadata source. For example, JDBC and Hive catalog follow “db.table” pattern, file catalog follows “scheme:///<file_path>” pattern.

##### Catalog for relational data structure

The relational data structure referrers data stored in DB or DWS, and organized hierarchically like `db.table` or `a.b.c`. With such metadata, we defined several catalog interfaces to support manipulating relational metadata.

![catalog-interface](catalog-interface.png)

- **BaseCatalog**: `BaseCatalog` is the base class for catalog, the implementation should inherit it to implement its own.
- **SupportNamespaces**: `SupportNamespaces` provides the APIs to create structured metadata, like `Database`.
- **TableCatalog**: `TableCatalog` defines the APIs to manipulate `Table` and it's `Column` entities. The specific `TableCatalog` implementation should also implement `Table` and `Column` to satisfy the specific underlying metadata source.
